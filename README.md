# Kevin's Dotfiles
I am Kevin and these are my dang dotfiles

## Instructions

To use these dotfiles you will need to install `bashdot`:

```
brew install bashdot
```

I only have one configuration, `default`, which can be linked to one's home directory with

```
bashdot install default
```

See (bashdot's documentation)[https://github.com/bashdot/bashdot] for more information
